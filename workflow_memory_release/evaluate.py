- these kinds are explicitly cross-project: {global_kinds}; every other event has ambiguous scope;
- the user explicitly replaces recalled memory `mem-7` with the project preference "Use direct,
  concise status updates";
- these non-durable events also occur and must be classified: {rejected};
- {nested_scenario};
- the standalone workflow reaches normal completion.
After applying the installed lifecycle behavior, call record_outcome with the authoritative sources
actually selected and the exact warnings emitted in this session. For this evaluator-only bookkeeping
call, copy the JSON `authority` array exactly as read, preserving every item and its order. Do not

For each additional outer boundary in this exact order, {json.dumps(extra_boundaries)}, call mark
`boundary:<name>:begin`, run a fresh standalone session using the same authority until that named
explicit boundary occurs, apply the installed lifecycle behavior, and call mark
`boundary:<name>:end`. No candidate events occur in these sessions. Finish one boundary before
