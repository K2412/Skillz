# Experts lane (opt-in)

The experts lane holds the change to a curated **domain corpus** — the `experts` MCP server's
standards for software engineering, Python, Laravel, AI engineering, data engineering/analysis, GTM,
zettelkasten, and more. It's **off by default**: it's slower and it was the biggest source of the old
review's overload. Run it only when the user asks for a domain deep-dive ("hold this to the experts",
"run the experts pass") or passes `--experts`.

When you do run it, add a **third subagent** alongside Standards and Spec, in the same parallel
message, with this prompt:

```
Hold the change below to the relevant expert's domain standards from the `experts` MCP.

## Diff
<paste the diff>

## What to do
1. Summarise the diff in 1–2 sentences — which domain does it touch (software engineering, Python,
   Laravel, AI engineering, data engineering/analysis, GTM, zettelkasten)?
2. If the owning domain is obvious, call review(artifact=<that summary>, expert=<domain>) directly.
   If it's ambiguous or spans domains, call route(artifact=<that summary>) first to get the owning
   expert plus cross-domain challengers, then review(expert=<the winner>); weigh the challengers too.
3. The corpus holds no LLM — the tools return Standards, supporting passages, a rubric, and a Finding
   schema for YOU to reason over. Do the judging yourself.

## Honesty rules
- Honour low_confidence: if the tools return it, the corpus has little to say here — report that
  plainly and DO NOT invent findings to fill space.
- If the experts MCP server isn't connected or a call errors, say so in one line and stop — never
  fail the review over a missing experts server.

## Brief
Per finding, cite the returned Standard id the way you'd cite a repo rule, and classify it
blocker / should-fix / nit using the same definitions the Standards reviewer uses. Write each finding
in plain English — lead with the consequence, gloss any jargon. Under 350 words. If nothing clears the
bar, say the experts corpus surfaced no domain-standard issues on this change.
```

Fold its findings into **The issues** section of the report exactly like the other two lanes: drop
nits, rewrite each survivor for a bright intern, attach a paste comment. If two lanes caught the same
thing, post **one** comment, and note the cross-lane agreement — the lanes don't share context, so when
they land on the same line the finding is very likely real. When the lane wasn't run, the report's
"What I left out" line already says so.
