description: Interview the user relentlessly about an idea until you reach shared understanding, while actively maintaining the project's domain model (glossary + ADRs) as terms and decisions crystallise. Use when the user wants requirements pinned down before building: "grill me on this", "interrogate this idea", "help me nail down the design", "challenge my thinking on X", "what am I not considering?", "let's scope this properly", or as the first stage of /pair. Produces a decision log plus any CONTEXT.md / ADR updates that later spec or planning work builds on. Do NOT use it to write code or a spec — this stage only reaches shared understanding.

# Grill — interview to shared understanding, with active domain modelling

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of the idea until reaching shared understanding.
Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one at a time.
**Alongside the interview, actively maintain the project's domain model** — challenge fuzzy terms,
invent edge-case scenarios, and capture terminology and irreversible decisions to disk as they
crystallise.

This skill presumes the direction is **already decided** — it extracts and pins down *what exactly*
to build. If the decision itself is still open — *should we? which direction? is it worth it?* —
settle that first; grill funnels toward pinned requirements and doesn't reopen whether to build at all.

If the work is **too big for one session** — you hit questions you can't answer without research, a
prototype, or more grilling, and find yourself lost in fog — a single grill won't clear it. That's
[`wayfinder`](../wayfinder/SKILL.md), which charts the whole thing as a map of decision tickets over
many sessions (and dispatches this skill for its grilling tickets). Grill is the single-session
primitive; wayfinder is the multi-session orchestrator around it.

**Interview rules — ask round-by-round, not one-at-a-time:**
- Map the idea as a **decision tree** and work it in **rounds**. Each round, ask *every* question whose
  prerequisites are already settled — the whole current frontier — in one `AskUserQuestion` call
  (it takes up to 4 questions at once). One answer often unlocks the next layer; ask that layer next
  round. This lands ~13 questions in ~3–4 rounds instead of 13 sequential prompts.
- Only hold a question back when it *genuinely* depends on an answer you don't have yet. Don't
  serialise independent questions just because they're related.
- For EVERY question use `AskUserQuestion` so the user picks from options instead of typing free-text.
  Generate 2–4 concrete, mutually exclusive options each. Put the recommended answer first and append
  "(Recommended)" to its label. Put nuance in the description field.
- **Facts the environment can answer, don't ask — dispatch.** If a question is answerable from the
  codebase, config, or git history, send a background `Explore`/`general-purpose` subagent to resolve
  it while you keep grilling, and fold the finding in when it lands. Reserve the user's rounds for
  decisions only they can make.
- Users always have "Other" available — don't force a fit when the answer space is genuinely open.

## Load the domain model at the start

Before the first question, check for existing domain files:
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at repo root → multi-context repo; use it to route to the right sub-context's `CONTEXT.md` and ADR directory.
- **`CONTEXT.md`** at repo root or under a subdirectory → single-context; read it so you can challenge conflicting terms.
- **`docs/adr/`** (or context-specific ADR directory) → scan for existing decisions relevant to this area.
- If none of the above exist, that's fine — create them lazily when the first term or ADR is warranted.

## During the grill — active modelling behaviours

Apply these alongside the normal interview:

- **Challenge against the glossary.** If the user uses a term that conflicts with an existing `CONTEXT.md` entry, call it out immediately: "Your glossary defines X as A, but you seem to mean B — which is it?"
- **Sharpen fuzzy language.** If the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term: "You said 'account' — do you mean Customer or User? They're different things."
- **Discuss concrete scenarios.** When domain relationships come up, stress-test them with specific edge-case scenarios that force precision about boundaries.
- **Cross-reference with code.** If the user states how something works, check the code. If it disagrees, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

## Update CONTEXT.md inline (do not batch)

The moment a term is resolved, write it to `CONTEXT.md` immediately. Format:

```md
# {Context Name}

{One or two sentence description of what this context is.}

## Language

**Order**:
{One or two sentences — what it IS, not what it does.}
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction
```

Rules:
- Be **opinionated**. When multiple words exist for the same concept, pick the best and list the rest under `_Avoid_`.
- **Tight definitions** — one or two sentences max.
- **Only project-specific terms.** General programming concepts (timeouts, utilities) don't belong even if used often. Ask: is this concept unique to this context, or general programming? Only the former belongs.
- **CONTEXT.md is a glossary. Nothing else.** No specs, no implementation notes, no decisions. Decisions go in ADRs.

Create `CONTEXT.md` lazily — the first time a term is resolved.

## Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when **all three** are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — cost of changing your mind later is meaningful.
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **Result of a real trade-off** — genuine alternatives existed and you picked one for specific reasons.

If any of the three is missing, skip it. Easy-to-reverse decisions get reversed; unsurprising decisions need no note; no-alternative decisions have nothing to record.

**Qualifies:** architectural shape, integration patterns between contexts, tech choices with lock-in, boundary/scope decisions, deliberate deviations from the obvious path, invisible constraints (compliance, SLOs), non-obvious rejected alternatives.

**ADR format** — live in `docs/adr/`, sequential numbering (`0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, ...). Scan for the highest existing number and increment. Template:

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1–3 sentences: context, decision, why.}
```

That's it. Add `Status` frontmatter, `Considered Options`, or `Consequences` sections **only** when they add genuine value.

## Finishing

Continue until the user signals completion ("ready", "ship it", "let's go", "do it", or any clear go-ahead). When done, capture and hand back:
- The full decision log — every Q/A pair resolved.
- Any new/updated `CONTEXT.md` entries.
- Any new ADR file paths.

Whatever consumes this next — a spec, a prototype, or the user's own head — builds on those three. If a look/feel/behaviour question surfaced that only a running artifact can settle, say so and point at [`prototype`](../prototype/SKILL.md).
